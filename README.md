## Cloud DevOps Nanodegree Capstone Project

This is the Capstone Project where I could demonstrate all the things that I have learned in the Nanodegree Program.

### Ojective of the Project

The main objective is to use AWS, Jenkins, Docker and Kubernetes to develop a microservice application, containerize the microservice application and build a CI/CD pipeline for that application. Finally deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster.


### Tasks to be completed [TODOs] --

- [ ] Step 1: Propose and Scope the Project
- [ ] Step 2: Use Jenkins, and implement blue/green or rolling deployment
- [ ] Step 3: Pick AWS Kubernetes as a Service, or build your own Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Step 4: Build your pipeline
- [ ] Step 5: Test your pipeline

### Project Rubics to be met --

- [ ] Create Github repository with project code
- [ ] Use image repository to store Docker images
- [ ] Execute linting step in code pipeline
- [ ] Build a Docker container in a pipeline
- [ ] The Docker container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Use Blue/Green Deployment or a Rolling Deployment successfully
